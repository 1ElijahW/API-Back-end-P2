## Project Proposal
## Project Goal and Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly website called "Cineflix" that allows visitors to search for movies basic information on that film. Also view ratings. The purpose is to provide users with an efficient way to find the movies they are looking for and expand their options by having access to a larger pool of results.

## Choice of API and Integration
For this project, I have chosen to use the Movies Database API. You can find the API documentation by clicking [HERE](https://www.omdbapi.com/) . I will integrate this API by making HTTP requests directly to the API endpoints using the 'Axios' method.


## User Stories
As a user, I should be able to:

- CRUD routes:
- GET /movie/:name - This route is used to fetch a specific movie by its name.
- POST /movie/:name - This route is used to create a new movie contributed by the user.
- PUT /movie/:name - This route is used to update a specific movie by its name.
- DELETE /movie/:name - This route is used to remove a movie by its name.


- GET /ratings/:name - Fetch a rating by it's id
- POST /ratings/:name - Create a new rating contributed by the user.
- PUT /ratings/:name - Update a specific rating by id.
- DELETE /ratings/:name - Remove a rating by name.

## Models
Movie Schema
```
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  year: { type: Number, required: true },
  genre: { type: String, required: false },
  director: { type: String, required: false },
  plot: { type: String, required: false },
});

const Movie = mongoose.model('Movie', movieSchema);

export default Movie;

```
Rating Schema
```
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const ratingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  source: { type: String, required: true },
  value: { type: Number, required: true },
});

const Rating = mongoose.model('Rating', ratingSchema);

export default Rating;

```

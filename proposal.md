## Project Proposal
## Project Goal and Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly website called "Cineflix" that allows visitors to search for movies by title or names of actors. The purpose is to provide users with an efficient way to find the movies they are looking for and expand their options by having access to a larger pool of results.

## Choice of API and Integration
For this project, I have chosen to use the Movies Database API. You can find the API documentation by clicking here. I will integrate this API by making HTTP requests directly to the API endpoints using the 'Fetch' method.

## Data Model and Seeding the Database
[Provide details about your data model and how you plan to seed your database. Include information about the entities, their relationships, and how you will populate the initial data.]

## User Stories
As a user, I should be able to:

- Search for movies by title
- Search for movies by names of actors
- See a list of popular movies
- Filter movies by genre
